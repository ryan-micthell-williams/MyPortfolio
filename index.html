      <!--establish who you are and where your are located right off the bat-->

      <p> I'm a software developer based in Memphis, TN.</p>

      <p> As a former sonography trainee who interned alongside ultrasound technicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a second degree black belt // part-time instructor in Taekwondo, there's three things I value above all other in my professional life:</p>

      <ol>

        <li> <b>Integrity</b> - the compulsion and the fortitude to stick to one's principles and ethics even in the face of adversity. </li>

        <li> <b>Discipline</b> - the desire and the dedication to perform one's duties to the best of their ability.</li>

        <li> <b>Teamwork</b> - mutual respect and professional communication among coworkers that fosters grand achievement via cooperation.</li>

      </ol>

      <h3> [ The Man Behind the Monitor ] </h3>

     <!--divulge the driving force behind your decision to enter this field as well as other hobbies and interests that also stem from your defining characteristics-->

      <p>All my life, I have possessed an insatiable desire to learn and expand my horizons both intellectually and professionally.</p>

      <p>Before I began my quest to become a software engineer under the tutelage of the wonderful minds at Thinkful, I found myself pursuing a career in medicine. Unfortunately, that journey was put on an indefinite hold due to the ever-increasing severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

      <p>But the show must go on, and I have never been one to linger in stagnant waters for very long. In the indefinite interim between my departure and my uncertain return to ultrasound school, I felt compelled to satisfy my technological curiosity and pursue a career in another field that greatly interested me.</p>

      <h4> | My Passions & Hobbies | </h4>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Filmmaking</b> - I have helped produce several short films and music videos with my friends and local creators. </li>
        <li><b>Political Activism</b> - I find it incredibly important to peacefully advocate for the change I wish to see in the world. I work hard to stay involved and informed about the issues present within my community, and assist those who are striving to address them.</li>
        <li><b>Health & Fitness</b> - I am a firm believer that diet is the best medicine. I have been a vegan for over five years, and I enjoy spreading tips and advice about the lifestyle to all who find it interesting. Additionally, as a martial artist, I find myself equally enthusiastic about staying in shape. Whether its sparring, running, biking, or weightlifting, I try to regularly push myself physically.  </li>
