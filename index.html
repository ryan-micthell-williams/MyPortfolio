              <p>
                All my life, I have possessed an insatiable desire to learn and expand my horizons both intellectually and professionally.

                Before I began my quest to become a software engineer under the tutelage of the wonderful minds at Thinkful, I found myself pursuing a career in medicine. Unfortunately, that journey was put on an indefinite hold due to the ever-increasing severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                But the show must go on, and I have never been one to linger in stagnant waters for very long.

I seek to realize a dream encapsulated quite poetically in a quote from a deeply flawed yet brilliant crusader of computational innovation, the late Steve Jobs,

          [T]he computer is the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with. It's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. What if, instead of being in the right hands, it was in everyone's hands? Everyone in the world.
